# vgotjs0318

all the solutions for problems that we solve in classes will be in class_work folder
Students should not check-in anything into class_work folders (i.e. it is strictly for class examples)

all the solutions for problems that students solve in codingbat.com should be in codingbat folder
all the solutions for problems that students solve in codewars.com should be in codewars folder

IMP. NOTE:
All student work that's in codingbat & codewars folders must be organized into respective branches designated for students.
e.g. aditya should check-in into these folders in 'aditya' branch --- not on main branch of these folders
     same applies for rest of the folders

thanks!
